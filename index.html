              Kanmani moleeeeee....❤️ Ente jeevan anu chakkaree ponnmol...
              Innu(ennum) nammude first Valentines Day aanu chakkare 
              And although I think that this day
              is much too hyped, I can’t help but miss you when I think that we could've been togather. Things would have
              turned out very differently if we were married and living happily ever after.(kurach divasam koodi kanmani molee❤️)
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I totally understand that the distance between us is just a silly
              number pakshe ente kunj mol ente aduth eppozhum venam chakkare. Ponnmol 
              aduth undayirunnenkil ente kunjine enikk ethilum nallonam care cheyyanum
              snehikkanum pattiyenae chakkare.. nammalde sneham vech nokkumbo Valentines day
              okke namukk normal alle chakkare, Vere divasangalil enich ente kunjinod
              olla sneham ethiri enkilum kurayuvo... Ellaaa!, Ennalum there is
              this teeny-tiny part of me that wants to able to celebrate ‘The
              Day Of Love‘ with you.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              So what if we couldn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day together? It
              doesn’t define our relationship, does it? And it isn’t the end of
              time, either! There’ll be many more Valentine’s Days to be
              celebrated with you, and everything will be alright.
              Besides, we don’t need a Valentine’s Day to tell each other how
              much we love to each other.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I tried so hard to pass it off as just another day in the
              calendar. But I could not. The truth is that I miss my mol more than anything
              and I am waiting for the day We get married and live the rest of eternity happily with 
              my ponnmol! Until then, I guess I’ll just have to be
              patient - which I do not know I can be.
            </h2>

            <h2>
              Last but not least, Happy Valentine’s Day, Kanmani moleee❤️. I
              love you sooo sooooooo muchhh umbuduu, more than anything chakkareee and you know that.
               I miss my Kanmani❤️ every second I dont get to spend with
              my Dumbiri Mol❤️. There are more walks to walk and places for us to travel, Ente kunjinte kunji kai pidich,
               lots of silly
              things to be done and Goals to be achived, Molk njanum, enikk ente kunjum.
              Love you infinity Kanmani❤️ Ummmmmmmmmmmwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaahhhhhhhhh😘😘😘😘👄👄👄
